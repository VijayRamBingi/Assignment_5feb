    "##### The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, known as a class. It allows you to control the access to data by providing public, private, and protected access modifiers. Encapsulation helps in keeping the implementation details hidden and provides a clear interface for interacting with the objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Abstraction: Abstraction involves simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on relevant attributes and behaviors. It allows you to focus on essential features while ignoring unnecessary details. In OOP, you can create abstract classes or interfaces that define the structure and common behavior, which concrete classes can then implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (superclass or base class). It promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes. Subclasses can extend or override the behavior of the superclass, leading to a more organized and modular code structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables you to write code that can work with objects of multiple types without needing to know their specific classes. Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and method overloading. Method overriding allows subclasses to provide their own implementation of methods inherited from the superclass, while method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters to be defined within a class hierarchy.\n",
